# How to use the IdleDetector API

The IdleDetector API is currently available in chrome canaries under a flag:

1) Download chrome canary ([android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.canary), [desktop](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/)).
2) Navigate to `chrome://flags` and enable `Experimental Web Platform features`.
3) Navigate to a test page, e.g. https://code.sgo.to/tmp/idle.html
4) Go idle

qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver Lock

On GNOME, this is the channel:
